            <h1>History and Modern Trends in Version Control Systems</h1>
            <p>Version control systems (VCS) are crucial tools for tracking changes to files
            over time. They enable team collaboration, maintain a detailed history of edits, and 
            make it easy to revert to previous versions when necessary. ere you can explore the 
            evolution of version control, from early centralized models to today's distributed 
            systems. his guide compares popular tools such as CVS, Subversion, and Git, and explains 
            the differences between centralized and distributed approaches. You'll also learn about 
            modern trends like GitOps, integration with CI/CD pipelines, cloud-based platforms, and 
            the role of AI in version control. Real-world examples and case studies are included to 
            demonstrate how these systems are used in practice.</p>

            <p>Explore the <a href="history.html">history</a> of version control systems and 
            learn more about <a href="trends.html">modern trends</a> shaping how developers work today.</p>

            <p>Version control systems have transformed from basic file-saving tools into the 
            foundation of almost all software development today. They facilitate collaboration, 
            whether you're a student working on projects with friends or part of a massive team with 
            thousands of developers.</p>

            <p>Gaining insight into the history—from RCS through Git and beyond—helps us understand 
            why modern version control tools function as they do. Embracing current practices like 
            Git-centered workflows, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD), and the growing 
            role of AI can help you develop and release software more effectively and reliably.</p>
