            <h1>Modern Trends in Version Control Systems</h1>
             
            <p>Version control systems have grown far beyond simple code tracking tools. 
            Today, they are deeply integrated into development workflows, enabling 
            automation, collaboration, and intelligent code management. New practices and 
            platforms have transformed how teams work, increasing efficiency and code 
            quality.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>GitOps:</b> Applies Git workflows to infrastructure management, 
                    treating infrastructure as code. Changes are reviewed and versioned 
                    like software, triggering automated deployments and ensuring consistency.</li>
                <li><b>CI/CD Integration:</b> Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment 
                    pipelines connect directly to version control, automatically building, 
                    testing, and releasing code changes for faster, more reliable delivery.</li>
                <li><b>Cloud-Based Platforms:</b> Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket 
                    offer rich collaboration features, including pull requests, issue tracking, 
                    built-in CI, access control, and social coding that support projects of all sizes.</li>
                <li><b>AI-Assisted Development:</b> Artificial intelligence enhances code review, 
                    merge conflict resolution, bug prediction, and even generates commit messages. 
                    AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot help developers write better code faster.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Together, these trends have made version control an essential hub for modern 
            software development. By combining automation, social collaboration, and 
            intelligent assistance, they help teams deliver higher quality software more 
            efficiently and adapt quickly to change.</p>
