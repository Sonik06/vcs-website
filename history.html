            <h1>History of Version Control Systems</h1>

            <h3>Evolution of VCS</h3>
            <p>Version control systems (VCS) have evolved from centralized 
                tools to distributed models. Early systems relied on a single server, while 
                modern ones support collaborative, decentralized workflows.</p>
            <p>Here is a brief timeline of key developments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1972: Source Code Control System (SCCS)</b> - One of the first version control systems, developed at Bell Labs. Tracked code changes on IBM mainframes.</li>
                <li><b>1982: Revision Control System (RCS)</b> - Local tool for tracking individual file changes using delta storage.</li>
                <li><b>1986: Concurrent Versions System (CVS)</b> - Enabled networked collaboration on projects. Popular in the 1990s despite technical limitations.</li>
                <li><b>2000: Subversion (SVN)</b> - Centralized system with atomic commits and better file handling. Designed to improve on CVS.</li>
                <li><b>2005: Git and Mercurial</b> - Introduced distributed version control. Git, created by Linus Torvalds, became the industry leader.</li>
                <li><b>2008: GitHub</b> - Web platform built on Git, offering features like pull requests and issue tracking. Accelerated Git adoption.</li>
                <li><b>2010s: Adoption of Git</b> - Widespread migration from older systems (CVS, SVN) to Git across open-source and enterprise projects.</li>
                <li><b>Late 2010s: GitOps and CI/CD Integration</b> - Git used to manage infrastructure. CI/CD pipelines and cloud-hosted VCS tools became standard.</li>
                <li><b>2020s: Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Collaboration</b> - Platforms like GitHub reached massive scale. AI tools began supporting code reviews and management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Difference between Centralized and Distributed Version Control</h3>
            <p>Version control systems can be centralized or distributed. Centralized 
            systems, like RCS, CVS, and Subversion, use a single central server where 
            all code is stored. Developers must connect to this server to pull updates and 
            commit changes. While simple and easy to manage, centralized systems rely 
            heavily on server availability, creating a single point of failure. Branching 
            and merging are also more difficult, limiting flexible workflows.</p>

            <p>Distributed version control systems (DVCS), such as Git and Mercurial, give 
            every developer a complete copy of the repository and its history. This allows 
            for offline commits and faster local operations. Developers can later sync their 
            changes by pushing or pulling from others or a central repository.</p>
            
            <h3>Why distributed VCS changed the game?</h3>

            <p>The biggest advantage of distributed VCS is how they handle branching and 
            merging. DVCS makes these operations easy and efficient, supporting parallel 
            development and non-linear workflows. This flexibility has made distributed 
            systems the standard in modern software development.</p>

            <p><b>Key benefits of distributed VCS:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Offline work and full local history</li>
                <li>Strong branching and merging support</li>
                <li>Multiple collaboration models</li>
                <li>Built-in redundancy and resilience</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In summary, distributed VCS offer greater flexibility and reliability than 
            centralized systems, which is why tools like Git dominate todayâ€™s 
            development workflows.</p>
